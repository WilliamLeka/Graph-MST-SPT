# MST/SPT Assignment

## Purpose
This ReadMe file documents the implementation of various algorithms, including Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), for the module "Algorithms and Data Structures". The assignment was extended to include both Dijkstra's Shortest Path, and Kruskal's MST.

## Graph Representation
Graphs are represented using an adjacency list data structure, which is well-suited for sparse graphs. This structure involves creating an array of nodes, with each node representing a vertex and having its own linked list of connected nodes. This approach is chosen over matrix representation due to its efficiency with sparse graphs.
